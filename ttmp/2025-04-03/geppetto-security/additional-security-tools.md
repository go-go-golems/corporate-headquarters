## Recommended Additional Tools for Immediate Implementation

Based on the go-go-golems/geppetto repository being a Go library with SOC2 compliance requirements, we recommend the following additional tools for immediate implementation:

1. **gosec**: For Go-specific security scanning
2. **SonarCloud**: For comprehensive code quality and security analysis
3. **OSSF Scorecard**: For continuous security health assessment
4. **git-secrets**: For local prevention of secret leakage
5. **nancy**: For additional Go dependency vulnerability scanning

These tools complement the GitHub Actions workflows we've already designed and provide additional layers of security that align with SOC2 compliance requirements.
