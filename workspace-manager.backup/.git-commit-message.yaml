title: ðŸ“š Update IMPLEMENTATION.md to reflect new project structure
description: |
  Updated comprehensive implementation documentation to match reorganized codebase structure:
  
  - Changed main.go location from root to cmd/workspace-manager/main.go
  - Updated command files location from cmd/ to cmd/cmds/
  - Updated core logic imports from cmd package to pkg/wsm package
  - Fixed all file path references throughout the document
  - Added package separation benefits and architecture advantages
  - Updated code examples to show new import paths (wsm.NewWorkspaceManager())
  - Added notes about TUI location in cmd/cmds/tui.go
  - Updated development setup commands to use new build path
  
  The document now accurately reflects the clean separation between CLI interface (cmd/) and business logic (pkg/wsm/), maintaining all technical detail while fixing structural references.
